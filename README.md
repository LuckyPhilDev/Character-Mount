**Character Mount** gives each of your characters a personal mount list and summons a random mount from it with a single button press.

### Features

- **Per-character mount list** — every character gets their own curated set of mounts, stored account-wide in SavedVariables.
- **Onboarding wizard** — on first login, suggests racial mounts, class mounts, and notable rare mounts. Pick what you want and get started in seconds.
- **Spell form support** — Druid Travel Form, Dracthyr Soar, and Worgen Running Wild are treated as mounts and randomised alongside journal mounts.
- **Random summoning** — click the macro to summon a random mount from your list, automatically filtered by context (ground, flying, or water).
- **Mount Journal integration** — Add and remove mounts from the list from the mount journal.
- **Source tags** — colour-coded pills show each mount's origin: Racial, Class, Manual, Suggested, or Rare.
- **Excluded mounts** — removed mounts appear in an "Excluded" section with a one-click restore.
- **Settings panel** — configure options and view your mount list via ESC > Options > AddOns, or `/cmount settings`.
- **Debug mode** — account-wide toggle to print mount selection diagnostics to chat.
- **Open Mount Journal** — quick-access button in both the mount list and settings panel.

### How to Use

1. Install the addon (requires **Lucky's Utils** dependency).
2. Log in — the onboarding wizard appears automatically for new characters.
3. Select the mounts you want and click **Add Selected**.
4. Type `/cmount macro` to create an action bar macro, then drag it to your bar.
5. Click the macro to summon a random mount from your list.

You can re-run the onboarding at any time via the **Setup** button in the mount list, or `/cmount reset onboarding`.

### Known Issues & Notes

- The first macro click after creating the macro uses a fallback random mount. Subsequent clicks use the full random pool including spell forms.
- Spell form availability is checked via `IsSpellKnown()` — if a spell is temporarily unavailable (e.g., level-restricted), it won't appear in the pool.
- Profession mounts (tailoring carpets, engineering machines, etc.) are filtered out of onboarding suggestions.
